Description

N1 Healthâ€™s client, a national Medicare Advantage plan, is seeking to understand how best to use its resources to address food access challenges in its membership. N1 Health has been tasked with presenting a short analysis (~5-10 minutes) of publicly available data to the Chief Medical Officer to answer this question. The guiding questions are:

1.	Where should we deploy a food access program?
2.	How many people will be included? How many might be successfully engaged?
3.	Which subgroup of the population might benefit the most from the program?
4.	What is the projected impact of this program? 

This project answers all of the questions in the Jupyter Notebook, the powerpoint presents the findings in a organized way.
